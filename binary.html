    <h1> Binary Representation </h1>
    <p>
        Binary is a base-2 number system invented by Gottfried Leibniz that's made up of only two numbers or digits: 0 (zero) and 1 (one). <br>This numbering system is the basis for all binary code, which is used to write digital data such as the computer processor instructions used every day.
