    <h1> Hexadecimal Representation </h1>
    <p>
        

Hexadecimal is a base 16 number system used in computing.<br>

In comparison, the counting we learnt at primary school is actually a base 10 number system (often called decimal or denary), and binary is base 2.<br>

Base 16 means that each position in a hexadecimal number comprises of one of 16 options.<br>

Hex looks odd because we donâ€™t have 16 original number symbols that we can use to represent these 16 possible options, so we have to use both numbers and letters from the alphabet.<br>
