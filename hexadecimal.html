    <h1> Hexadecimal Representation </h1>
    <p>
        Definition from WhatIs.com Hexadecimal describes a base-16 number system.<br> That is, it describes a numbering system containing 16 sequential numbers as base units (including 0) before adding a new position for the next number. (Note that we're using "16" here as a decimal number to explain a number that would be "10" in hexadecimal.)
